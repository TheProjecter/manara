Small Linux Distribution for ARM platforms having a GUI created with Qt Embedded.
This distribution will target small embedded projects which needs a customized Linux OS with a small GUI, and it will run applications programmed in C, C++ and Qt.
It will be Open Source and free to use and redistribute.
It's Made In Egypt :)
I hope MANARA could help others in their work.
